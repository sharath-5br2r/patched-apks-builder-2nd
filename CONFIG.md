# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

## More about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.  

```toml

```

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "latest"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'latest' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Current Limitations**: 
> Due to how the underlying CLIs handle arguments, `included-patches` and `excluded-patches` currently only apply to the **last** patch bundle in your `patches-source` list. 
> Per-bundle selective inclusion/exclusion (e.g. including one patch from the first bundle, and excluding another from the second) is not currently supported in this config format. If you use multiple sources, it is recommended to apply all patches from the preceding bundles.
